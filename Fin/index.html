                Web development is the coding or programming that 
                enables website functionality, per the owner's 
                requirements. It mainly deals with the non-design 
                aspect of building websites, which includes coding 
                and writing markup.
            </p>
            <p>
              Web development ranges from creating plain text 
              pages to complex web-based applications, social network 
              applications and electronic business applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most web devs use Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), 
              Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), 
              and JavaScript to develop websites.
            </p>
            <p>
              HTML defines the basic framework of a website - 
              the foundation upon which everything else is built
               upon. It forms the blocks that define a page's layout,
                format, and critical components. Although it is 
                theoretically possible to code a website on HTML only, it will be just a barebone site with no functions unless it’s enriched with CSS and JavaScript. Also, even simple style modifications such as changing the color of a button
               require a lot of coding to be executed using HTML only.
            </p>
            <p>
              CSS is used to style the content of a website using 
              a small set of files that are kept across the entire
              site. This way, whenever a change must be applied to 
              say, consistently change the color of all the buttons
              found in every page of the website,
              a web dev needs to edit only a single file in CSS.
            </p>
            <p>
              The JavaScript programming language is used 
              to take care of the interactivity of many unique 
              website elements. It can be used to create effects
               that alter the appearance of icons and drop-down 
               menus, add animations, 
              games, and other interactive elements.
            </p>
            <p>
              Web developers are usually divided into front-end devs,
               back-end devs, and full-stack devs. A front-end dev 
               takes care of all the visual aspects of the website 
               (layout, navigation bar, etc.), its interactivity, 
              and binds together all its elements.
            </p>
            <p>
              Back-end devs take care of less visible tasks that 
              ensure the website runs smoothly, such as managing 
              the website’s hosting services, database, and 
              applications. Back-end devs might need to engineer
               solution to server issues by using additional server-side
               languages such as Python, Ruby, Java, and PHP.
            </p>
            <p>
              Full-stack devs are developers able to do both front-end and 
              back-end tasks at the same time.
